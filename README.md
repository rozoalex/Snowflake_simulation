# Snowflake_simulation
Simulate the generating of snowflake

The way a snowflake is generated depends on two variables, Beta and Gamma.

Through modifying Beta and Gamma carefully, we can get different styles of snowflake.

This will be implemented using Python for a bigger scale simulation[.](http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html).
